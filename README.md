# Sample React App

This is my playground for react code. Github offers free client side hosting (sorry no php or node scripts here). So far this site has two basic react apps. Everything was built using react, redux, es6, bootstrap 4 and webpack.

### Blog Posts

The blog post portion fetches an api using axios. It then displays a number of posts and the user
can navigate through the pagination. 

My todos:
add search
add grid vs list view using bootstrap
create a blog post

### Cart App

This is a basic shopping cart working with redux. It fetches a list of images from a public api - I then add on a random price (it changes every time) and seed the cart with a few items. From there you can increase / decrease or remove items from the cart.  

My todos:
see if there is a free credit card test api


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Installs the node modules

### `npm start`

Runs the application

### `npm run deploy`
 
Publishes to github pages
